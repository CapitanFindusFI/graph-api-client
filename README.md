# Graph API Client
JS Library created to simplify using of GraphQL by using a defined structure for queries and mutations, instead of passing raw strings to the API handler

Just create an instance of the `GraphAPIClient` object and it will take care of the rest

```
class GraphAPIClient {
    constructor(axiosRequestConfig){
        // will create its own instance of Axios client
        this.axios = new axios(axiosRequestConfig);
    }
}
```

then just call the `.query` or the `.mutation` methods to enjoy magic things

The main class `GraphQLRequest` is being extended by `GraphQLQueryRequest` and `GraphQLMutationRequest`, and is being utilized to generate GraphQL query string,
used by the `GraphAPIClient` with its methods `.query` and `.mutate`

### Requests Generation

Both GraphQL queries and mutations are being generated by the [*graphql-request-generator*](https://github.com/CapitanFindusFI/graphql-request-generator)
library, which I made.
